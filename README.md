You will need a local server to run the application. Can be launched using VS Code, Live Server plugin.
Or the _[serve](https://github.com/vercel/serve)_ npm package, which allows you to quickly deploy
a local server on your machine.

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn build
```
